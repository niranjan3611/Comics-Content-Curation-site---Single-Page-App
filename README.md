## Description ##
The group project for module 3 is to create a website for collecting and organizing content.

Some sites that can serve as inspiration:

- pinterest: users save images to "boards".
- pocket and delicious: users save and organize URLs
- zotero: users save academic articles, organize them into groups, tag them, and export them in various formats
- reddit and hackernews: users post, vote on, and discuss URLs

Generally, these sites allow users to (a) collect content into collections, lists, or tags, (b) annotate the content with additional information, and (c) browse and search for other information on the site.

We encourage you to build a site to curate content that's interesting to you. Ideas:

- Airbnb rentals
- NPM packages
- Amazon products
- NES ROMs


## Requirements ##

- Build a site on react, express, and mongo. Host the site on heroku.
- The site must allow users to:
  - Add new content.
  - Edit existing content, e.g., by changing its description or giving it a descriptive tag
  - Delete existing content
- The site must allow the content to be organized.  E.g., collections, lists, or tags.
- The site must allow users to browse the site in a reasonable way via links.


### Encouraged, but optional ###

- Content import via identifier (e.g., URL). Many interfaces (Facebook, Slack, Pocket) allow users to add links, which the site then parses to find some content (e.g., a title, an image). Allow your users to do something similar.
- Search. Add a site-search feature that allows users to find content. It does not count to add a google site search box :)  This could, for example, be an autocomplete widget that shows tags, or an open-ended widget that searches the text of imported items.
- Multi-user support.  Allow multiple users to independently contribute content.  There is no need for full authentication, but you could allow users to "log in" by typing a username.  You could simply track and display activity by user, or to be more ambitious, you could give different users different views (e.g., the homepage shows the logged-in user's collections).
- Responsive design. Make the site render in a usable way on an iphone 7 (or equivalent).


## Submission ##
- Your code should be pushed up to your repo on github
- Fill this `README.md` out with your team name, team members' emails, and
- Heroku url for your demo. Additionally, complete the argument sections at the top of the file.


## Grading ##
You will be graded on the __ambition__ and __execution__ of the project. At the top of this `README.md` you have the opportunity to argue why your submission was ambitious and well executed. In order for us to grade it, you must have it hosted on Heroku. To earn an "A" grade, a project must be technically ambitious, well-executed, and polished. To earn a passing grade, a project must minimally fulfill the three requirements listed in the description.
